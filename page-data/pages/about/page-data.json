I got into data science through\nchemical engineering, so, you know, the usual way. My research wasn’t very\nconducive to data science, so I kind of made my own path. I co-founded\n<a href=\"http://penndsg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Penn Data Science Group</a>, applied as many good coding\nand data analysis practices as I could to my research, and ran a couple\ntutorials/workshops to share useful tools (like Jupyter, Pandas, and Git) in\nPDSG events and research lab meetings. I did a few side projects to pick up\nskills outside of research. Here are some of the projects I had the most fun\nwith:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pbcluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>PBCluster</strong></a>: This is the only\none that actually had to do with my research. I put together a Python package\nthat I don’t think anyone but me will use, but I had fun doing it and learning\nhow to put together a tested, object-oriented, documented, pip-installable\npackage that helped at least 1 person (me) with their research.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/posts/comparing-collaborative-filtering-methods\"><strong>Collaborative Filtering Methods Comparison</strong></a>:\nA detailed blog post comparing several collaborative filtering models for\nmovie recommendation with the MovieLens dataset.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/datathon-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Citadel Data Open Championship</strong></a>:\nMy team’s report from the final round of a national datathon analyzing\neducation data</li>\n<li><a href=\"/posts/interactive-d3-map-of-baby-name-popularity\"><strong>Interactive Baby Name Popularity Map</strong></a>:\nAn interactive map made with D3.js that lets you explore baby name popularity by time and\nlocation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nflfantasydashboard.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>NFL Fantasy Draft Dashboard</strong></a>:\nA dashboard made with Plotly Dash just for fun to try to help with a 2018 NFL\nfantasy draft. Turned out to be useless, but it was fun putting it together.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So many people helped me in my career development and job search process leading\nup to landing an exciting data science job, so I’m always happy to (try to) pay\nit forward with advice, encouragement, or connections.
