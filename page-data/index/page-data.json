Getting your production site up and running can still be a bit of a hassle though, so to save myself, and hopefully a few others, from this hassle in the future, I'm recording all the steps that worked for me here."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/running-jupyter-lab-remotely","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Jupyter Lab Remotely","date":"2018-04-30","category":"Data Science","description":"I'm a huge fan of Jupyter Notebooks, and I was very excited when I found out about Jupyter Lab, which provides a much more comprehensive user experience around Jupyter Notebooks. Here I share how to run Jupyter Lab efficiently on a remote machine. I have a research cluster where I do most of my analyses for my PhD work, and running Jupyter Lab directly on the cluster means I don't have to copy files between the cluster and my desktop."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/taking-advantage-of-sparsity-in-als-wr-algorithm","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Taking Advantage of Sparsity in the ALS-WR Algorithm","date":"2017-2-11","category":"Data Science","description":"The ALS-WR algorithm works well for recommender systems involving a sparse matrix of users by items to review, which happens when most people only review a small subset of many possible items (businesses, movies, etc.). By tweaking the code from a great tutorial to take advantage of this sparsity, I was able to dramatically reduce the computation time."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/analyzing-larger-than-memory-data-on-your-laptop","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Analyzing Larger-than-Memory Data on your Laptop","date":"2017-03-10","category":"Data Science","description":"If you want to run some analysis on a dataset that's just a little too big to load into memory on your laptop, but you don't want to leave the comfort of using Pandas dataframes in a Jupyter notebook, then Dask may be just your thing. Dask is an amazing Python library that lets you do all your Pandas-style dataframe manipulations with just a few simple tweaks so you don't have to worry about Jupyter freezing up."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/dealing-with-grid-data-in-python","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dealing with Grid Data in Python","date":"2016-12-08","category":"Data Science","description":"In my PhD research, I do a lot of analysis of 2D and 3D grid data output by simulations I run. In my analyses, it's very helpful to restructure these data into a more useable format. A few key lines of python code do the trick."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/interactive-d3-map-of-baby-name-popularity","categorySlug":"/category/projects/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interactive D3 Map of Baby Name Popularity","date":"2016-07-24","category":"Projects","description":"I built a D3 map showing baby name popularity by state with an interactive time slider you can use to see how the popularity changes over time.

It can be very tedious to manually create input files for each job, so I wrote a bash script to help me out."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":10,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
