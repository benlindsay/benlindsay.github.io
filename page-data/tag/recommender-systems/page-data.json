By tweaking the code from a great tutorial to take advantage of this sparsity, I was able to dramatically reduce the computation time."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/analyzing-larger-than-memory-data-on-your-laptop","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Analyzing Larger-than-Memory Data on your Laptop","date":"2017-03-10","category":"Data Science","description":"If you want to run some analysis on a dataset that's just a little too big to load into memory on your laptop, but you don't want to leave the comfort of using Pandas dataframes in a Jupyter notebook, then Dask may be just your thing. Dask is an amazing Python library that lets you do all your Pandas-style dataframe manipulations with just a few simple tweaks so you don't have to worry about Jupyter freezing up."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"tag":"recommender systems","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":10,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/recommender-systems","nextPagePath":"/tag/recommender-systems/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
