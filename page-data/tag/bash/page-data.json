Here I share how to run Jupyter Lab efficiently on a remote machine. I have a research cluster where I do most of my analyses for my PhD work, and running Jupyter Lab directly on the cluster means I don't have to copy files between the cluster and my desktop."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/parameter-sweep-bash-script/","categorySlug":"/category/projects/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Parameter Sweep Bash Script","date":"2015-12-19","category":"Projects","description":"In my polymer field theory research, often my studies involve running a bunch of simulations where I pick one or more input parameters and change them over a range of values, then compare the results of each separate simulation to see how that/those variable(s) affect the system Iâ€™m simulating. It can be very tedious to manually create input files for each job, so I wrote a bash script to help me out."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"tag":"bash","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":10,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/bash","nextPagePath":"/tag/bash/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
