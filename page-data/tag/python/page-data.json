Getting your production site up and running can still be a bit of a hassle though, so to save myself, and hopefully a few others, from this hassle in the future, I'm recording all the steps that worked for me here."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/taking-advantage-of-sparsity-in-als-wr-algorithm","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Taking Advantage of Sparsity in the ALS-WR Algorithm","date":"2017-2-11","category":"Data Science","description":"The ALS-WR algorithm works well for recommender systems involving a sparse matrix of users by items to review, which happens when most people only review a small subset of many possible items (businesses, movies, etc.). By tweaking the code from a great tutorial to take advantage of this sparsity, I was able to dramatically reduce the computation time."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/analyzing-larger-than-memory-data-on-your-laptop","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Analyzing Larger-than-Memory Data on your Laptop","date":"2017-03-10","category":"Data Science","description":"If you want to run some analysis on a dataset that's just a little too big to load into memory on your laptop, but you don't want to leave the comfort of using Pandas dataframes in a Jupyter notebook, then Dask may be just your thing. Dask is an amazing Python library that lets you do all your Pandas-style dataframe manipulations with just a few simple tweaks so you don't have to worry about Jupyter freezing up."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/dealing-with-grid-data-in-python","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dealing with Grid Data in Python","date":"2016-12-08","category":"Data Science","description":"In my PhD research, I do a lot of analysis of 2D and 3D grid data output by simulations I run.
